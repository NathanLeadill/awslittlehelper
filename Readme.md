# Welcome to AWSLittleHelper

Hi! I'm Nathan, and when I began using aws to handle storage for my Node apps, It took me a while to piece together the right stackoverflow questions to upload to S3 correctly. So I created awslittlehelper to allow people to quickly import functionality to access S3 and store data there from Express api's.

Below there is also examples for passing data to this form from a variety of sources, sweetalert2, react and others.


# Installation

To get started you need to install the latest version of awslittlehelper and its dependencies which you can install by running.

    npm install awslittlehelper
This should install the module to your work area and allow you to require it with the following line of code

    const alh = require('awslittlehelper')
 or
 

    import * as alh from 'awslittlehelper'
